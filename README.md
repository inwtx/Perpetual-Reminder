# Perpetual-Reminder
Daily scheduler program

This program was written by me back in the 1990s.  I lost control of it on SourceForge.  There have been a few changes since and the GUI is now longer.  If you are already using the original version, you should be able to copy the old 'system' folder into this new installed version.  Your messages should display correctly.
